These two values will generate a random amount of spread between the Lower value and Range
The higher value is calculated automatically with no input
~ Use this mechanism with a MaxWallHeight value of 5-10 to make piles of particles more harder to break apart

RANGE = 80 | LOWER = 10
will spread more flat and even

RANGE = 80 | LOWER = 50+
will make a spike effect when pixels cascading/falling down in a pile, not ideal

RANGE = 60 | LOWER = 30
will make a ledge/pile effect, it will look like the piles of pixels have different levels of platforms
